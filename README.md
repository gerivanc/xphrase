# 🧩 XPHRASE GENERATION

**Expressive phrase generator — strong, modern, and minimalist.**  
Built entirely in Python for CLI environments on Linux and Windows.

--- 

# 🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**XPhrase Generation** is a multilingual phrase generator designed for command-line interface (CLI) usage.  
It creates expressive, randomized phrases using words from **Portuguese**, **English**, and **German**, interlinked with special characters and digits.
The principle of randomness enables the generation of over 12.6 trillion unique combinations by interconnecting words from three languages, along with the inclusion of special characters and numerical digits.

This project is:
- 💯 Written 100% in Python
- 🖥️ CLI-compatible for Linux and Windows
- 🌐 The CLI project has been fully converted to the web version of the HTML interface, maintaining the same phrase generation method, now accessible directly in your browser.

# 📜 DISCLAIMER
Do not attempt to memorize the passwords generated by this tool. Instead, use a reliable password manager, such as [Bitwarden©](https://bitwarden.com/), which I personally recommend. The only password you should memorize is the master password for your password manager's vault, created with a strong combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to enhance security. A great option for managing your 2FA is Ente Auth , a free, open-source, and cross-platform app that provides end-to-end encrypted backups. [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/) ensures your 2FA codes are secure and synced across devices, with externally audited encryption, offering robust protection for all your accounts that support 2FA.

# 🔐 GENERATION RULES

- Phrase length: **3 to 21 words**
- Each word must include:
  - **1+ special character**
  - **1+ digit**
- Final word must end with a **capital letter**
- Language order is **randomized**

---

# 📚 WORD BANK SPECS

- It contains 4,000 specific words, selected from the vocabulary of three different languages.
- This project was created by selecting words to generate sentences in three languages: English, Portuguese, and German.
- All words are stored in separate `.txt` files inside the `data/` folder.
- Words are randomly selected and mixed across languages.

| Language    | Word Count |
|-------------|------------|
| English     | 1,334      |
| Portuguese  | 1,333      |
| German      | 1,333      |

# 📊 XPhrase Generation Calculation Methodology
Generation phrase  by Phrase Formation Rules:

For a phrase with \( n \) words (\( 3 \leq n \leq 21 \)):

### 1. **Word Selection**
   - Each word is selected **randomly with replacement** from the pool of 4,000
   - Language origin is **random per word** (uniform distribution across 3 languages)
   - **Order matters**, repetitions allowed

### 2. **Per-Word Modification**
   For each selected word:
   - Insert **at least one digit** (`0–9`) → 10 options
   - Insert **at least one special character** from:
     ```
     !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?~\\
     ```
     → **29 special characters**
   - Insertions occur **between letters**, **before**, or **after** the word
   - **Multiple insertions allowed** (no upper limit per word)
   - **No fixed pattern** — randomness ensures entropy

### 3. **Inter-Word Linking**
   - Words are **concatenated directly** with their modifications
   - No fixed separator between augmented words
   - Example: `davor,9Möglichkeit]3ThermometeR`

### 4. **Final Word Capitalization**
   - The **last character of the final word** must be a **letter** and is **forced uppercase**
   - If the last character after modification is not a letter, a **valid letter is appended and uppercased**
