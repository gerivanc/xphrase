# 🚀 XPHRASE GENERATION

**Expressive phrase generator — strong, modern, and minimalist.**  
Built entirely in Python for CLI environments on Linux and Windows.

--- 

## 🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**XPhrase Generation** is a multilingual phrase generator designed for command-line interface (CLI) usage.  
It creates expressive, randomized phrases using words from **Portuguese**, **English**, and **German**, interlinked with special characters and digits.

This project is:
- 💯 Written 100% in Python
- 🖥️ CLI-compatible for Linux and Windows
- 🌐 Future-ready for HTML interface integration

---

## 📦 FEATURES

- Generates phrases with **3 to 21 words**
- Words are randomly selected from **Portuguese**, **English**, and **German** word banks
- Each word is **interlinked** with:
  - At least **one special character**: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?~\\`
  - At least **one digit**: `0123456789`
- The **last character of the final word** is always **uppercase**
- Output example:  
  `ice8café*intentos7vermeideN`

---

## 🛠️ REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies
- Works on:
  - ✅ Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, etc.)
  - ✅ Windows (PowerShell, CMD)

---

## 📜 Disclaimer
Do not attempt to memorize the passwords generated by this tool. Instead, use a reliable password manager, such as [Bitwarden©](https://bitwarden.com/), which I personally recommend. The only password you should memorize is the master password for your password manager's vault, created with a strong combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to enhance security. A great option for managing your 2FA is Ente Auth , a free, open-source, and cross-platform app that provides end-to-end encrypted backups. [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/) ensures your 2FA codes are secure and synced across devices, with externally audited encryption, offering robust protection for all your accounts that support 2FA.
